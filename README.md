## Distributie

De website wordt automatisch gedistribueerd wanneer er commits in `master` zijn

The site is automatically deployed when commits land in `master`, via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you are the maintainer of a community translation fork and would like to deploy via Netlify instead of GitHub pages, please ping @yyx990803 in an issue to request a Netlify team membership and DNS update.


### Want to help with the translation?

If you feel okay with translating sorta alone, you can fork the repo, create a "work-in-progress" issue to inform others that you're doing the translation, and go for it.

If you are more of a team player, Translation Gang might be for you. Let us know somehow that you're ready to join this international open-source translators community. Feel free to contact [Grigoriy Beziuk](https://gbezyuk.github.io) or anybody else from [the team](https://github.com/orgs/translation-gang/people).

And thank you in advance ;) -->
